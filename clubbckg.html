    <h3>Gary, Treasurer</h3>
    <p>Hi. Gary's the name. I wrote my senior thesis on a fight I got into with a rat in the subway. He thought he could get away with pickpocketing me.</p>
    <p>Well. I showed him. </p>
    <p>He did bite off a bit of my ear. I'll tell anyone who'll listen about it. I'm definitely not wanted for fraud and embezzlement in 3 countries.</p>
